## Getting to know you questions

### Introduce yourself


### Why do you want to leave the current company ?

- Currently, I work for FRSPL, India Pvt. Ltd. but I work as contractor. I am looking for a permanent position.
- I am on special contract where I can work from home. I chose this when my child was born. 
- Since the current company, the requirement is to be available and only those who can get any promotion. This means my current contractual role is making my career stagnant. 
- I am looking to get promoted and apply the skills that I learn/learning towards new challenges
- Since I moved to India and still working as South African contractor (in a way), I find many cultural differences like many company events that I am never part of.
### What are you looking for in your next role ?

- **Challenge**: Need a way to apply my skills and improve while at it.
- **Culture**: Be part of an office culture again. 
- **Professional Development opportunity**: New position means new training (official or on work) and opportunity to learn. 
- **Personal reason**: Want to feel like working at office again.

### What frustrates you ?

- My frustration is usually connected with in-efficiencies (mine or someone else's), lack of improper process, obstacles that hinder progress.
- But with experience, I have learned that frustration also can be a positive force (catalyst for positive change). 
- So, I try to channel my frustration towards improving something or being proactive and bring about a positive change.
- Example: 
	- When Apache camel was first introduced in our organisation, I found it hard to understand. It was quite verbose. I was not alone in this frustrating situation. So, I decided to take one EIP at a time and write custom shareable code. This developed into custom DSL that we used in all our BFF applications.
	- Another example is when I introduced check-styles to improve coding practices. In some micro-services, there were more than 1000 violations and doing it by 1 person would be a very frustrating things, I got all devs in a teams meeting and we all agreed to divide and conquer. The result is that now all developers have fixed so many violations, that for many, it became second nature to follow the style guide.
