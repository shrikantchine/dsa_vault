## What are the required qualities ?

- **Motivation** - What drives you? Ideal candidates are self-motivated, passionate about technologies and products that have a real impact.
- **Ability to be Proactive** - Are you able to take initiative? Given a difficult problem, are you able to figure out how to get it done and execute on it?
- **Ability to work in an unstructured environment** - How well are you able to take ownership in ambiguous situations? Or do you rely on others to be told what to do?
- **Perseverance** - Are you able to push through difficult problems or blockers?
- **Conflict Resolution** - How well are you able to handle and work through challenging relationships?
- **Empathy** - How well are you able to see things from the perspective of others and understand your motivations?

## STAR Method

- **Situation** - The interviewer wants you to present a recent challenge and situation which you found yourself in
- **Task** - What were you required to achieve? The interviewer will be looking to see what you were trying to achieve from the situation. Some performance development methods use "Target" rather than "Task". Job interview candidates who describe a "Target" they set themselves instead of an externally imposed "Task" emphasize their own intrinsic motivation to perform and to develop their performance
- **Action** - What did you do? The interviewer will be looking for information on what you did, why you did it, and what the alternatives were
- **Results** - What was the outcome of your actions? What did you achieve through your actions and what did you learn? What steps did you take to improve after the experience?
